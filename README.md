###ZoomingPDFViewerSwift
简单的PDF浏览器。使用UIPageViewController和CATiledLayer<br>
Multi-paged PDF viewing with UIPageViewController demonstrates two-page spline viewing in landscape orientation, which looks like a book within iBooks. The sample also uses UIScrollView and CATiledLayer to support zooming within a single-page view used in portrait orientations. This app is universal and only supports the two-page spline view in landscape orientation on iPad.
###ABUIGroupsSwift
AddressBook.framework应用.通讯录分组操作<br>

###AccelerometerGraphSwift
CoreGraphics.frameworks和CoreMotion.frameworks应用。检测加速计并绘制图像。由于原版使用UIAccelerometer已弃用，故改用CoreMotion
AccelerometerGraph sample application graphs the motion of the device. It demonstrates how to use the UIAccelerometer class and how to use Quartz2D and Core Animation to provide a high performance graph view. It also demonstrates a low-pass filter that you can use to isolate the effects of gravity, and a high-pass filter that you can use to remove the effects of gravity.
